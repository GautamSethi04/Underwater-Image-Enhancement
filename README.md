# Underwater-Image-Enhancement

This project enhances underwater images using Python and OpenCV. It addresses common issues like poor visibility, color distortion, and low contrast through techniques such as histogram equalization, white balancing, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization). The code includes functions for computing image entropy, applying superpixel segmentation, and enhancing image contrast. The processed images are compared against the original ones to assess improvements in clarity and detail, with entropy metrics used to quantify the enhancement. The project is ideal for improving the visual quality of underwater photographs.
